# Slop Review v0.1.0

First Marketplace release. Highlights:

- Reusable JavaScript action (no dependencies), Node 20 runtime
- Comments on pull requests with a humorous, overconfident review
- OpenAI integration (optional): add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to generate deluxe slop
- Safe fallback: built-in jokes when no API key or model call fails
- Idempotent-ish: updates its own prior comment when re-run
- Inputs: `model` (default `gpt-4o-mini`), `temperature` (default `0.95`), `max_files` (default `10`)

```

Notes:
- GITHUB_TOKEN is provided automatically by GitHub Actions
- OPENAI_API_KEY is optional; without it the action still posts a review
- Please file issues or suggestions on the repository
